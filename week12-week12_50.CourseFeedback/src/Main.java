        Overall this course was great. I learned a lot about java and OOP. The exercises were very helpful.

        Some negatives about the course:
            - The English needs improvement ASAP. Part 2 especially. At times, it was very difficult to understand
            the lecture material and exercise instructions. I wasted hours of valuable time on problems because of a
            misunderstanding in the English.

            - The exercises were great but not always worded well (see my first negative about the English). I believe
            I could have completed the course in half the time if instructions were more clear.
